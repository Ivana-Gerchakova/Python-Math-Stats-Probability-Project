# Project Title :
Python Math & Stats Probability Project.

## Project Overview :
This project involves the analysis and modeling of various datasets using statistical methods. 
The goal is to gain insights into the underlying distributions, and relationships between variables, 
and explore the effectiveness of statistical models in making predictions or drawing meaningful conclusions.

## Project Highlights :
1. Salary Distribution Analysis:
a) Overall Distribution:
Utilized the MajorSalary.xlsx dataset to characterize the distribution of monthly salaries for employees based on their majors.
Examined the center, variability, and skewness of the entire dataset.
Conducted analysis using appropriate visualizations to illustrate key findings.
b) Distribution by Major:
Categorized salary data by major to identify similarities and differences in salary distributions.
Implemented visual displays to highlight variations in salary based on different majors.

2. Spam Filter Analysis:
a) Bayesian Spam Filter:
Applied Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of an email being spam based on the presence of specific words.
b) Word Indicators:
Analyzed the probability of a message being spam based on the presence of specific words.
Identified which word serves as a stronger indicator for spam.
c) Additional Word Indicators:
Explored the impact of specific words on the probability of a message being spam.

3. Poisson Distribution Analysis:
Employed the Poisson distribution to model the probability of catching a certain number of fish per hour.
Calculated,tabulated and visualized probabilities.

4. Joint Frequency Distribution Analysis:
a) Marginal and Conditional Distributions:
Derived marginal frequency distributions of random variables X and Y.
b) Expected Values and Conditional Expectations:
Calculated expected values E(X) and E(Y).
c) Conditional Variance:
Computed conditional variance Var(X|Y).
d) Random Variable W:
Defined a random variable W = E(X|Y = y) with distribution.
Calculated E(W).
e) Additional Analysis:
